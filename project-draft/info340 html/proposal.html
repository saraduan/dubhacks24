            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p> We aim to develop a comprehensive platform facilitating easy access to part-time
                job opportunities within the local community. 
                This application, akin to platforms like LinkedIn or Handshake, will empower users
                to efficiently search, categorize job listings, communicate directly with employers, 
                and submit applications. Additionally, users can maintain a profile account, providing 
                detailed information to foster meaningful connections with potential employers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the presence of existing job-seeking applications, the majority of 
                traditional part-time job opportunities still rely on conventional methods like word of mouth, 
                physical flyers, or local social media pages. The proposed platform seeks to address 
                this gap by creating a centralized space that effectively connects individuals, particularly students,
                with local businesses. While platforms like <a href="https://www.indeed.com/"> Indeed</a> offer 
                job search functionalities, they often fall short in representing many small businesses, 
                possibly due to associated posting 
                <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/indeed-review-for-employers/">fees.</a> 
                Furthermore, Indeed lacks a comprehensive profile feed similar to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"> Linkedin</a> 
                limiting the ability to showcase detailed information about individuals and their professional portfolios.
                We aim to merge these two major platforms and enhance accessibility for the community.

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Our Application</h3>
                <p>Our application will allow users, mainly UW students and U-District residents, to have access to 
                    local job postings. On the other end, local business owners will be able to post job postings that 
                    are viewable by the students. This application will make employment opportunities more accessible, 
                    which is impactful especially for those who are underserved and maybe even low income. Having our 
                    application as a resource will provide more transparency among the community regarding job opportunities.

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    One feature that will be included in our application is the ability to post job opportunities on the side 
                    of the employer. This require them to create a profile for their business and post information such as the 
                    salary and the job description. Another feature that will be included is the ability to save job postings 
                    with the use of a starring button. This will allow the user to have a dedicated page that includes their 
                    “starred” or saved postings. Another feature that will be included is a review/rating system for businesses. 
                    For instance, the users will be able to give a rating out of five on their experience working for a business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users will be viewing data that is manually posted by local businesses, meaning there is no need 
                    for an external csv or API. All information will be made by the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application will help solve our problem as digital means of communication allow for more widespread communication. 
                    In this case, having a web platform containing local job postings that aren’t necessarily internships allows for more 
                    accessible opportunities for all. This gives employers more opportunities to hire employees when they are in need and 
                    this allows UW students to apply for such jobs easily.
